# video-calling-app
**The challenge is to build a Microsoft Teams Clone with AceHacker, in Microsoft Engage 2021.**

## Introduction
The aim of this project is to build a fully-functional prototype where a minimum of two participants can connect with each other to have a video conversation.

My solution is a video-calling web application built with WebRTC, Socket.io and Node.js that provides peer-to-peer video and audio communication in a web browser. 
Deployed on Heroku: https://frozen-earth-28579.herokuapp.com/

## Solution Functionalities
1. Join/create a room with a unique meeting id where multiple participants can join and start a conversation. Supports user authentication.

2. Join a video call with participants in the room. Video call features include:
    * Toggling of video/audio stream
    * Live Captions
    * Full-screen mode
    * Chat box
    * Invite participants from within the call

3. Continue the conversation after the video call has ended.
